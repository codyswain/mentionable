After graduating in computer science and electrical engineering, I opted to co-found a fintech startup instead of going back to work for Facebook. Alice specialized in a non-custodial contract wallet app for algo stablecoins. As the technical lead, I was instrumental in the development and architecture of the product. We secured a seed round from notable investment firms.

Over the course of 6-8 months, we built the product, partnering with PrimeTrust for fiat onramps and Torus key management. Our tech stack was diverse: we used Pulumi for infrastructure as code, hosted a Postgres database on a serverless AWS instance, and implemented a GraphQL API. I took a deep dive into areas like database design and microservice orchestration.

We quickly onboarded 10K users and had a waitlist of 30K. While preparing for a Series A fundraising round, the collapse of a major algo stablecoin led to the company's dissolution.

The core team and I covered various roles, both technical and strategic. I was mainly focused on technical architecture, database design, and state machine complexities.
